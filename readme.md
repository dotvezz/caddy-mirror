## Building with `xcaddy`

As with all Caddy plugin modules, you can use the [`xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy) tool to compile 
Caddy with this plugin included.

```sh
> caddy build --with github.com/dotvezz/caddy-shadow
```

## Caddyfile

caddy-shadow fully supports Caddyfile as well as native JSON configuration.

### Example File

```caddyfile
{
    metrics
}

http://localhost:8080 {
    shadow {
        metrics shadow
        compare_body
        primary {
            reverse_proxy https://my-old-backend.com
        }
        shadow {
            reverse_proxy https://my-new-backend.com
        }

## Response Comparison

caddy-shadow provides a set of simple, optional features for comparing the shadowed response against the primary
response.

- Straight comparison of response body
- For JSON responses: JQ queries to select certain aspects of the JSON to compare, ignoring the rest of the result
- Comparison of response headers
- Comparison of response status codes

### Comparison Result Reporting
